# hello-world
This is a place where you can see and participate, in the progression of an idea in auto-motives.
Right now, I'm an automotive driver who delivers vehicles to different dealer locations.  I've been interested in vehicles, and like the way our society is evolving in the automotive industry.  For one, we're taking on a role of more cleaner, efficient vehicles.  Soon, we'll enter into the electrical car life.  Help me out folks, it's still a progressive idea.  Yet, once we're all plugging our cars into sockets like you would a lawnmower, then it's "the chill life".

I like to go out and be in the water, got a wife and daughter, and come from a loving family.  As you all know, vehicles are one of the number one leading causes of human fatalities.  So with that being said, buckle up, and drive safe.  My other hobby is playing the piano.  I was self taught, and compose songs on an electric piano with weighted keys.

So if you now know a little about me, I'd love to hear a little about you, and see where we can bridge the gap between the evolution of cars in this new age.  Don't be shy, share your ideas!  Sometimes life is too short not to pray and live it to the fullest, to serendipity...
